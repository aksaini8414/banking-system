# Banking System Project

## Overview

The Banking System project is a software application designed to simulate basic banking functionalities using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in Java. The system allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, transfer money between accounts, and view account balances.

## Features

1. **Account Management:**
   - Create new accounts with unique account numbers.
   - Store account information such as account holder name, account number, balance, etc.
   - Validate account details to prevent duplicate accounts.

2. **Transaction Handling:**
   - Deposit funds into accounts.
   - Withdraw funds from accounts with sufficient balance.
   - Transfer funds between accounts.
   - Perform error handling for insufficient balance or invalid transactions.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Implement a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.
   - Provide menu options for various banking operations.

4. **Data Security:**
   - Implement secure authentication mechanisms for user access.
   - Encrypt sensitive data such as account numbers and passwords.

## Object-Oriented Design

The project follows a modular and object-oriented design approach with the following classes:

1. **Account:**
   - Represents a bank account with attributes such as account number, account holder name, balance, etc.
   - Includes methods for deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, and transfer.

2. **Bank:**
   - Manages a collection of accounts.
   - Provides methods for creating new accounts, accessing existing accounts, and performing transactions.

3. **Transaction:**
   - Represents a transaction such as deposit, withdrawal, or transfer.
   - Stores transaction details like transaction type, amount, timestamp, etc.

4. **UserInterface:**
   - Handles user input and displays output.
   - Provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the banking system.

## Data Structures & Algorithms

1. **ArrayList or HashMap:**
   - Use ArrayList or HashMap to store account details efficiently.
   - Implement data structures for fast retrieval and manipulation of account information.

2. **Search and Sort Algorithms:**
   - Utilize search algorithms like linear search or binary search for account lookup.
   - Implement sorting algorithms like insertion sort or merge sort for sorting transactions.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Use exception handling mechanisms to handle errors such as insufficient balance, invalid account numbers, etc.
   - Implement data validation techniques to ensure data integrity.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-threading:**
   - Implement multi-threading for concurrent transaction processing.
   - Improve system performance and scalability.

2. **Database Integration:**
   - Integrate a database for persistent storage of account information.
   - Use SQL or ORM frameworks for data manipulation.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement stronger authentication mechanisms such as biometric authentication or two-factor authentication.
   - Enhance data encryption techniques for improved security.

## Conclusion

The Banking System project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming principles and Data Structures & Algorithms in developing a functional banking software. By following best practices in software design and development, the project aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for managing banking operations.
